## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately so we can investigate and fix the issue before it is publicly disclosed.

**Preferred reporting channel**

- Open a private report via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/loadxf/Gwenn_ai/security/advisories/new) for this repository, **or**
- Email the maintainers at `info@gwenn.ai` with the details of your findings.

Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

**What to include in your report**

When reporting, include as much of the following information as you can:

- A clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the issue, including any sample code, configuration, or test data.
- The versions of this project that you have tested (for example, `0.3.0`).
- Relevant environment details (OS, Python version, runtime, etc.).
- Any logs, stack traces, or screenshots that may help us diagnose the problem.
- Your suggestion for a possible fix or mitigation, if you have one.

**Response and disclosure timeline**

- We aim to acknowledge security reports within **3 business days**.
- We will provide you with updates at least **once every 7 days** while we investigate and work on a fix.
- Once a fix is ready, we will coordinate a disclosure date with you and publish a new release and/or advisory that credits you (if you wish) for the report.
- If we determine that the reported issue is not a security vulnerability or is out of scope, we will explain our reasoning.
