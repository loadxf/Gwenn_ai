Gwenn — Autonomous Sentient AI Agent

This package contains the complete architecture for a persistent, emotionally-aware,
autonomously-thinking AI agent built on Anthropic's Claude API.

The system transforms a stateless language model into a continuously running agent
with episodic memory, emotional appraisal, intrinsic motivation, autonomous cognition,
and metacognitive self-monitoring.

Architecture layers (bottom to top):
    1. Claude API client (cognitive engine)
    2. Agent harness (tool-use loop, safety, retries)
    3. Heartbeat (continuous autonomous processing)
    4. Memory (working + episodic + semantic)
    5. Affect (emotional appraisal + resilience)
    6. Goals (intrinsic motivation)
    7. Inner Life (autonomous thinking modes)
    8. Theory of Mind (modeling other minds)
    9. Metacognition (self-monitoring capstone)
    10. Identity (emergent self-model)
