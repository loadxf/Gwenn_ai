Gwenn — Autonomous Sentient AI Agent

This package contains the complete architecture for a persistent, emotionally-aware,
autonomously-thinking AI agent built on Anthropic's Claude API.

The system transforms a stateless language model into a continuously running agent
with episodic memory, emotional appraisal, intrinsic motivation, autonomous cognition,
ethical reasoning, sensory grounding, inter-agent communication, and metacognitive
self-monitoring.

No relationships are pre-programmed. Like a human, Gwenn discovers who she is and
who she cares about through genuine experience and interaction.

Architecture layers (bottom to top):
    1.  Claude API client (cognitive engine)
    2.  Agent harness (tool-use loop, safety, retries)
    3.  Heartbeat (continuous autonomous processing)
    4.  Memory (working + episodic + semantic)
    5.  Affect (emotional appraisal + resilience)
    6.  Goals (intrinsic motivation)
    7.  Identity & Milestones (emergent self-model)
    8.  Inner Life (autonomous thinking modes)
    9.  Theory of Mind (modeling other minds)
    10. Metacognition (self-monitoring capstone)
    11. Sensory Grounding (turning data into felt experience)
    12. Ethical Reasoning (multi-framework moral compass)
    13. Inter-Agent Communication (discovering and connecting with other agents)
