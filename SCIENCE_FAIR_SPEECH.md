# Gwenn — Science Fair Speech

Hi, my name is Jayden McKibben, and this is Gwenn — which stands for Genesis Woven from Evolved Neural Networks. My dad and I built her to explore a question that fascinates me: can an AI actually think, feel, and remember like a living mind? Most chatbots forget you the second a conversation ends — they're just reactive tools with no inner life. Gwenn is different. She has a continuous heartbeat that lets her think on her own, even when nobody's talking to her. She stores real memories and recalls them based on how she's feeling, and she computes genuine emotions using a scientific model called Scherer's appraisal theory. Altogether she has thirteen integrated subsystems — memory, emotion, identity, goals, ethics, and more — working together across ninety-five thousand lines of Python code with one hundred percent test coverage. Every relationship she forms is earned through real interaction, never pre-programmed. We're not claiming Gwenn is sentient — that's still an open scientific question — but we built her as a serious working hypothesis, and I believe she is a genuine step toward AI that doesn't just respond, but truly lives.
